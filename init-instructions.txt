## Disable lid switch

Ref: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/desktop_migration_and_administration_guide/closing-lid

Procedure 13.10. Configuring the lid switch

Open the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file for editing.
Find the HandleLidSwitch=suspend line in the file. If it is quoted out with the # character at the start, unquote it.
If the line is not present in the file, add it.
Replace the default suspend parameter with
    lock for the screen to lock;
    ignore for nothing to happen;
    poweroff for the computer to switch off. 
For example:

	[Login]
	HandleLidSwitch=lock

Save your changes and close the editor.
Run the following command so that your changes preserve the next restart of the system:

	$ systemctl restart systemd-logind.service

Warning
Keep in mind that restarting the service forcibly interrupts any currently running GNOME session of any desktop user who is logged in. This can result in users losing unsaved data.
